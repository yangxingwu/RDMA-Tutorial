     * 1. If the QP is in RESET, INIT or RTR state, an immediate error should

     * (to eliminate extra check in the data path, thus providing better
     * performance), and posting Send Requests at one or all of those states
     * may be silently ignored.
     * 2. If the QP is in RTS state, Send Requests can be posted,
     * and they will be processed.
     * 3. If the QP is in SQE or ERROR state, Send Requests can be posted,
     * and they will be completed with error.
     * 4. If the QP is in SQD state, Send Requests can be posted, but won't be
     * processed.
